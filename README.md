# Calendar Grid Component running on Storybook
## Installation
Storybook installed the Next.js builder when I did it the first time, but that option is no longer showing up so just use the Webpack5 builder instead.
### Clone repo
`git clone https://github.com/ge64/GridCalendar.git`
### Install dependencies
- `npm install`
### Install Storybook
`npx storybook@latest init`
- It should immediately start running locally, otherwise: `npm run storybook`
    - If it gives you webpack errors try: `npm run storybook --debug-webpack`
